# AP Microeconomics: Key Concepts and Formulas

## Unit 1: Basic Economic Concepts

### 1. Scarcity, Choice, and Opportunity Cost
- **Scarcity**: The fundamental problem; unlimited wants exceed limited resources (Land, Labor, Capital, Entrepreneurship).
- **Opportunity Cost (OC)**: The value of the next best alternative foregone.
- **Rational Behavior**: Individuals make choices to maximize utility/satisfaction.

### 2. Production Possibilities Curve (PPC) / Model (PPF)
- **Points on the curve**: Efficiently produced.
- **Points inside the curve**: Inefficient (unemployment or underutilization).
- **Points outside the curve**: Impossible given current resources.
- **OC on PPC**: The slope of the curve.
  - Straight PPC: Constant OC.
  - Bow-out PPC (typical): Increasing OC (due to specialized resources).
- **Economic Growth**: Outward shift of the PPC (due to new resources or technology).

### 3. Comparative Advantage and Gains from Trade
- **Absolute Advantage**: Ability to produce more of a good with the same resources.
- **Comparative Advantage**: Ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost.
- **Specialization & Trade**: Countries/firms should specialize in the good for which they have a comparative advantage.
- **Terms of Trade (TOT)**: Must be mutually beneficial, lying between the two producers' opportunity costs.

### 4. Economic Systems
- **Market Economy (Capitalism)**: Private ownership, decentralized decision-making, driven by self-interest and incentives.
- **Command Economy (Socialism/Communism)**: Government owns resources and dictates production.
- **Mixed Economy**: Most common (e.g., US), blends both systems.

### 5. Supply and Demand: The Basics
- **Law of Demand**: Inverse relationship between Price ($P$) and Quantity Demanded ($Q_D$).
- **Law of Supply**: Direct relationship between Price ($P$) and Quantity Supplied ($Q_S$).
- **Equilibrium**: $Q_D = Q_S$ (Intersection of $D$ and $S$).
- **Shifters**: Changes in Tastes, Income, Related Goods (Demand) or Input Costs, Technology, Expectations, Number of Sellers (Supply).

## Unit 2: Supply and Demand

### 6. Elasticity
- **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**: Measures responsiveness of $Q_D$ to a price change.
  $$\text{PED} = \frac{\\%\Delta Q_D}{\\%\Delta P}$$
  - Where $\\%\Delta Q_D$ and $\\%\Delta P$ are calculated using the midpoint method:
    $$\\%\Delta X = \frac{X_{\text{new}} - X_{\text{old}}}{(X_{\text{new}} + X_{\text{old}})/2} \times 100\\%$$
    (This method avoids bias from the direction of change.)
  - $|\text{PED}| > 1$: Elastic (responsive).
  - $|\text{PED}| < 1$: Inelastic (unresponsive).
  - $|\text{PED}| = 1$: Unit Elastic.
- **Total Revenue (TR) Test**:
  - Price $\uparrow$, TR $\downarrow$ $\implies$ Demand is Elastic.
  - Price $\uparrow$, TR $\uparrow$ $\implies$ Demand is Inelastic.
- **Cross-Price Elasticity (XED)**:
  - XED $> 0$: Substitutes.
  - XED $< 0$: Complements.
- **Income Elasticity (YED)**:
  - YED $> 0$: Normal Good.
  - YED $< 0$: Inferior Good.

### 7. Consumer and Producer Surplus
- **Consumer Surplus (CS)**: Difference between willingness to pay and price paid. Graphically: Area below Demand and above $P_e$.
- **Producer Surplus (PS)**: Difference between price received and cost of production. Graphically: Area above Supply and below $P_e$.
- **Total Surplus (TS)**: $TS = CS + PS$. Maximized at equilibrium.

### 8. Market Equilibrium and Changes
- **Shifts in Demand or Supply (or both)** change the equilibrium Price ($P_e$) and Quantity ($Q_e$).
- **Double Shifts**: When both $D$ and $S$ shift, either $P_e$ or $Q_e$ will be indeterminate.

### 9. The Effect of Government Intervention
- **Price Ceiling (Max $P$)**: Set below $P_e$. Creates a Shortage ($Q_D > Q_S$) and often Deadweight Loss (DWL).
- **Price Floor (Min $P$)**: Set above $P_e$. Creates a Surplus ($Q_S > Q_D$) and often DWL.

- **Per-Unit Tax (on Sellers)**: Shifts Supply left/up.
  - Tax Revenue $= \text{Tax per Unit} \times Q_{new}$.
  - Tax Incidence: The burden is shared, depending on relative elasticities (inelastic side pays more). Taxes create DWL.
- **Per-Unit Subsidy (on Sellers)**: Shifts Supply right/down. Increases $Q$, decreases $P_c$ (consumer price), increases $P_p$ (producer price).

## Unit 3: Production, Cost, and Perfect Competition

### 10. The Theory of the Firm
- **Explicit Costs**: Direct out-of-pocket expenses (wages, rent).
- **Implicit Costs**: Opportunity costs of resources already owned (e.g., foregone salary, foregone interest).
- **Accounting Profit**: Total Revenue - Explicit Costs.
- **Economic Profit ($\pi$)**: Total Revenue - (Explicit Costs + Implicit Costs).
- **Profit Maximization Rule (Universal)**: Produce where $MR = MC$.

### 11. Short-Run Production
- **Short-Run**: At least one input (usually Capital) is fixed.
- **Marginal Product (MP)**:
  $$MP = \frac{\Delta \text{Total Product}}{\Delta \text{Labor}}$$
- **Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns**: Adding additional units of a variable input (labor) eventually yields smaller increases in output.

### 12. Short-Run Costs
- **Total Cost (TC)**: $TC = \text{Total Fixed Cost} (TFC) + \text{Total Variable Cost} (TVC)$.
- **Average Total Cost (ATC)**:
  $$ATC = \frac{TC}{Q} = \text{AFC} + \text{AVC}$$
- **Marginal Cost (MC)**:
  $$MC = \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}$$
- MC intersects ATC and AVC at their minimum points. MC curve is typically J-shaped; ATC and AVC are U-shaped.

### 13. Long-Run Costs
- **Long-Run**: All inputs are variable.
- **Long-Run Average Total Cost (LRATC)**: An envelope of all short-run ATC curves.
  - **Economies of Scale**: LRATC $\downarrow$ as output $\uparrow$ (efficient specialization).
  - **Diseconomies of Scale**: LRATC $\uparrow$ as output $\uparrow$ (coordination problems).

### 14. Perfect Competition
- **Characteristics**: Many buyers/sellers, identical product, no barriers to entry/exit.
- **The Price Taker**: Firm takes the market price.
  $$P = MR = AR = D_{\text{firm}}$$
- **Profit Max**: Produce where $MR = MC$.
- **Short-Run**: Can earn $\pi > 0$, $\pi = 0$ (normal profit), or $\pi < 0$ (loss).
- **Shutdown Rule**: Firm should shut down if $P < AVC_{\min}$ (Price is less than minimum Average Variable Cost).
- **Long-Run Equilibrium**: Zero Economic Profit.
  $$P = MC = ATC_{\min}$$
  (Productive and Allocatively Efficient).

## Unit 4: Imperfect Competition

### 15. Monopoly
- **Characteristics**: Single seller, unique product, high barriers to entry.
- **Demand/MR**: The market demand curve is the monopoly's demand curve, and $D$ is greater than $MR$ ($P > MR$).
- **Profit Max**: Produce where $MR = MC$, but charge the price on the Demand curve.
- **Inefficiency**: $P > MC$, leading to less output and DWL compared to perfect competition (Not Allocatively Efficient).
- **Price Discrimination**: Charging different prices for the same product, requiring market power, no resale, and identifiable groups.

### 16. Monopolistic Competition
- **Characteristics**: Many sellers, differentiated products, low barriers to entry/exit.
- **Short-Run**: Can earn $\pi > 0$ or $\pi < 0$.
- **Long-Run Equilibrium**: Zero Economic Profit ($\pi = 0$) due to entry/exit.
  $P = ATC$ but $P > MC$ (Not Allocatively Efficient).
- **Excess Capacity**: Produces less than the $ATC_{\min}$ output level.

### 17. Oligopoly
- **Characteristics**: Few large firms, interdependence, high barriers to entry.
- **Collusion/Cartel**: Firms agree to act like a monopoly (illegal).
- **Game Theory**: Analyzes interdependent decision-making.
  - **Dominant Strategy**: Best strategy regardless of the opponent's choice.
  - **Nash Equilibrium**: Outcome where no player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy.

## Unit 5: Factor Markets

### 18. Derived Demand
- The demand for a resource (labor, capital) is derived from the demand for the product it is used to produce.

### 19. The Labor Market
- **Demand for Labor (Marginal Revenue Product - MRP)**: The additional revenue generated by an additional unit of labor.
  $$\text{MRP} = \text{Marginal Product} (MP) \times \text{Product Price} (P)$$
- **Supply of Labor (Marginal Factor Cost - MFC)**: The additional cost of hiring an additional unit of labor. For a perfectly competitive labor market, $\text{MFC} = \text{Wage}$.
- **Profit-Maximizing Hiring Rule**: Hire labor until
  $$\text{MRP} = \text{MFC}$$

## Unit 6: Market Failure and the Role of Government

### 20. Externalities
- **Market Failure**: Occurs when the private market fails to achieve the socially optimal quantity ($Q_s$).
- **Negative Externality (e.g., pollution)**: Production/Consumption creates costs for third parties.
  - Social Cost ($MSC$) > Private Cost ($MPC$).
  - Market overproduces ($Q_m > Q_s$).
  - **Solution**: Pigouvian Tax (per-unit tax on the externality generator).
- **Positive Externality (e.g., education)**: Production/Consumption creates benefits for third parties.
  - Social Benefit ($MSB$) > Private Benefit ($MPB$).
  - Market underproduces ($Q_m < Q_s$).
  - **Solution**: Subsidy.

### 21. Public Goods and Common Resources
- **Rivalry**: One person's use diminishes others' use.
- **Excludability**: People can be prevented from using the good.
- **Public Goods**: Non-rival & Non-excludable (e.g., national defense). Leads to the Free-Rider Problem (underproduction).
- **Common Resources**: Rival & Non-excludable (e.g., fish in the ocean). Leads to the Tragedy of the Commons (overuse/depletion).

### 22. The Economics of Government Regulation
- **Antitrust Laws**: Promote competition and prevent monopolies/cartels.
- **Addressing Natural Monopoly**: A single firm can produce at a lower cost than two or more. Government may regulate price:
  - Socially Optimal Price: $P = MC$ (Requires subsidy to prevent loss).
  - Fair-Return Price: $P = ATC$ (Zero economic profit).
